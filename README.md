# OPDB
A database/collection manager web portfolio, starting with OPTCG.

The main goal of this project is to create a portfolio manager for One Piece Card Game, meanwile, it will be a good database for all collections released or announced in Japan or the US.

Feel free to suggest any feature at issues or add your vision to the project with pull requests, they will all be noted and implemented if it makes sense.

Also, i'm new to programming so its only HTML and CSS at the moment, but features using JavaScript will be implemented as soon as i manage to learn more about the language.
